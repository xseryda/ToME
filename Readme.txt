This is a modification of the https://github.com/pulkit24/ToME/tree/master/upgrades mod for Age of Empires 2.

All the credits go to pulkit24 and other developpers of the ToME mod. They did 99.999% of all the work. They are still developing the main branch of the mod and the released version will be much better than this one.

The goal of this version is to make the mod playable while we wait for the final version developed by pulkit24 and his colleagues.
